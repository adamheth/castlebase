# Castle Base

I got this idea from [Mark Wunsch](https://github.com/mwunsch), who has a repo set up as a [homesick castle](http://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick). While that's cool, I'm a little too lazy to mess with the Ruby stuff.

So I'm going to keep this pretty dumb, to use `git clone` into `.castlebase` and then sym link in your `~`.

This is intented for personal use, but feel free to copy.r
